## Abstract
Pregnancy-induced physiological hemodynamic changes pose challenges in the application of serum creatinine (SCr)-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) formulas in pregnant women. From 0 gestational week (GW) to 41 GW, a total 1,484 SCr measurements from 957 healthy pregnant women were collected. Whole 42-GW was divided into 12 gestational periods (GPs), and a number of SCr measurement of each GP augmented to 120 using the resampling bootstrap method. The newly augmented values were designed to satisfy a Gaussian distribution, and a polynomial linear regression curve of median values was obtained. A hyperfiltration, a measured SCr concentration during pregnancy against non-pregnant state, was calculated. The regression curve provided a median value for each GW, and a median hyperfiltration, the provided median value against the non-pregnant state, was additionally calculated. Finally, the novel formula was a fusion of the two calculation methods. The same augmentation process was applied to eGFRs from 1,484 SCr measurements, and a sufficient amount through the augmentation could construct reference intervals of gestation SCr and eGFR.
